- [ ] Add error handling for invalid file paths
- [ ] Clean up code and add comments

Detailled todo list:

Implement File Open Functionality:
    Write a function to read a file and load its contents into a string or vector.
    Handle errors if the file does not exist or cannot be opened.
    Add basic unit tests to ensure files load correctly.

Add Ability to Edit Lines of Text:
    Create functions to add, modify, and delete lines in the text buffer.
    Update the user interface to allow editing (for now, this can be simple command-line prompts).

Save Changes to a File:
    Write the text buffer back to the original file.
    Add a confirmation prompt before saving.

Navigate Through Lines (Up, Down, Left, Right):
    Implement basic navigation, allowing the user to move around the text buffer.
    Ensure navigation behaves correctly when at the start or end of lines.

Add Error Handling for Invalid File Paths:
    Make sure your program catches and displays errors if it canâ€™t open or save a file.
    Test with various file paths to ensure robustness.

Clean Up Code and Add Comments:
    Go through your code and add comments to explain tricky sections.
    Organize functions and code into separate source and header files for clarity.
